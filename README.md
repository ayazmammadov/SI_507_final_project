# SI_507_final_project

I intend to create interactive program that users can find an info about a movie, like when the movie was filmed, who was the main actor/actress, who was the director of the movie and the picture of the movie.

The users will be able to look at the movie's trailer from youtube.

In order to achieve my goal I scraped and craweled the IMDB  then useing sql created movie database. Finally I used flask which created an html with top ten movies from IMDB with their pictures, director, year of the movie and etc. Then If you want to watch the trailer of the movie you click the picture and it will directly take you to youtube.
